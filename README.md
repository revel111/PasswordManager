# PasswordManager
Password manager on c++ and doxygen documentation. 
My second project written on c++. The main aim is OOP, dealing with files. An interesting part is XOR encryption which was used for hiding actual data in text files.
I provided additional documentation in doxygen style, but you will not find html files with it in this version of the project because html and css files have much more
lines of code than .cpp and .h files itself. (In early commits you can find html and css files).
